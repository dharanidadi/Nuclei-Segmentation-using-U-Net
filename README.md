# Nuclei-Segmentation-using-U-Net

I designed a deep learning model using the U-Net architecture for precise nuclei segmentation on tissue images. By training the model with Dice Loss and the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index, I achieved a Mean Dice Score of 0.73. To further enhance segmentation accuracy, I applied relevant morphological operations and utilized the Watershed Algorithm.
